1. Core is rejecting messages based on the current validator set, which is the
validators defined by the current height. If we assume that in an epoch all
validators rotate and none of them do so simultaneously, but instead that first
one validator changes receives the new block and realises they have been
elected and then a second and so on. The first validator will send its
consensus messages to all the validators that it sees, but none of those nodes
will know that they are validators yet and will discard the messages. The next
validator's message will only reach the first validators message and so on.
Averaging out over the whole set of validators we see that each validator will
receive messages from 1/2 of the other validators. This is not enogh to commit
to a value and so there will be a round change. This is an extreme case but it
highlights problems with this approach.
